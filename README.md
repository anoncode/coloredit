1. Copy the color file "DA_XXX_CustomizeSetting_01.uasset"  to "Z:\Program Files\StreetFighterVBeta\StreetFighterVBeta\Content\Chara\XXX\DataAsset"
Where Z is your drive letter and XXX is the character code like CMY, KEN etc. (this release is KRN)<br><br>

NOTE: Don't change the files while the game is minimized, you need to restart the game for colors to change otherwise old colors will load in selection menu.<br><br>

<b>SF5 color edit application:</b><br><br>

Requires .Net 2.0<br>
Color editor for DA_XXX_CustomizeSetting_01.uasset files.<br>
Parsing the items isn't perfect but works on all the current released characters as of 10/30/2015.<br>
Colors in palette slot 1 and 2 are used for 1st chosen/2nd chosen characters.<br>

Note: Some characters (ryu) have only 9 palette slots in the files and the tool does not handle this.
